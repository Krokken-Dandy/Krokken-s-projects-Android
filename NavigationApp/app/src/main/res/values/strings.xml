    <!--Strings of extra information for Breweries Fragment-->
    <string name="brewery_asher_description">This was Colorado\'s first all-organic brewery. Asher
        uses high quality ingredients in a socially responsible way. They employ a wide variety of
        sustainability efforts while proving that top-notch craft brewing can be done organically.
    </string>
    <string name="brewery_avery_description">This is an east Boulder legend that brews a wide range
        of beer. Avery backs up its regular lineup of traditional beers with dynamic sub&#8211;sets
        of other beers: Seasonals, The Holy Trinity of Ales, The Dictator Series, The Demons of Ale,
        The Barrel&#8211;Aged Series, and The Annual Barrel Series. If this means nothing to you,
        trust us: There is a ton of innovation, experimentation and craft happening at Avery.
    </string>
    <string name="brewery_beyond_description">When you\'re driving east&#8211;bound out of Boulder
        on the Diagonal, you\'ll see the sign for this brewery to the right, especially at night
        when it\'s lit up. Definitely pull off the highway to check this place out. You\'ll notice
        right away a west&#8211;facing patio with a good view of the mountains along with a dog
        &#8211;friendly environment. Once inside, look at the bar itself which features countless
        concert tickets in its design. So you won\'t be surprised to discover, right next to the
        bar, a stage with an excellent sound system. (Live performances are common here). The beer
        selection changes up often, to reflect the love for improvisational music.</string>
    <string name="brewery_boulder_beer_description">Colorado\'s First Microbrewery. Yep, all the
        way back in 1979, Boulder Beer pioneered craft beer for the rest of the Centennial State.
        Visit today and you will find an excellent range of beers &#8211;&#8211; from well&#8211;
        known year&#8211;rounders to seasonals and limited releases. There\'s a food menu, special
        beer and food deals on certain days of the week, and occasional live music.</string>
    <string name="brewery_BRU_description">When you enter BRU, it primarily feels like a restaurant.
        But take note: The Chef and Brewmaster are the same person here. So the Ales take no back
        seat to the \"Eats\"!. You will find a wide array of beers, all with \"handbuilt\" touches:
        Natural carbonation, no filtering, and no pasteurizing. Also, look for the occasional
        \"Chef\'s collaboration\" ale where BRU pairs up with other local chefs to brew a special
        beer.</string>
    <string name="brewery_cellar_description">Here\'s a brewery that really puts the Craft in
        craft brewing. The beers here are all farmhouse-style and wild ales, and most are fermented
        in oak barrels with a house blend of wild yeast. This means brett-forward, naturally
        carbonated beers. Some of them are dry-hopped for another layer of complexity and aromatics.
        As for the location, it\'s off the beaten path: Upon entering the narrow parking lot, keep
        going straight past a handful of other businesses, and beware of speed bumps. Once you open
        the door, you realize the intimate, candle&#8211;lit setting is just right for this
        sophisticated brewery. Choose from among a few taps, plus an array of bottles which can
        be opened and enjoyed on&#8211;premise.</string>
    <string name="brewery_fate_description">This is Boulder\'s first \"Brew&#8211;Bistro\" which
        helps make it unique. The interior design and overall ambiance is upscale; lots of seating
        both indoors and outdoors (the patio even has heat lamps for the colder days!) FATE
        emphasizes local ingredients in their food&#8230; and plenty of good beer. 30 taps, in
        fact&#8230; about 12 of which are FATE\'s beers. For something distinctive and fresh, try
        their Watermelon Kolsch Style Ale</string>
    <string name="brewery_finkel_garf_description">This brewery thinks outside the box; a visit
        here gives you a unique, unforgettable experience. For example, when you order a flight
        of beer, you can opt for food pairings&#8230; which means classic snacks: The Cream Ale
        pairs with Ritz Bits; The Oatmeal Milk Stout comes with a Hostess Twinkie. The bartender
        is also happy to blend beers for you. Be sure to check out their game selection which
        includes Table Top Bowling and Shuffle Board.</string>
    <string name="brewery_gunbarrel_description">Part of a string of businesses, this brewery is
        visible from N. 71st St, and you pull in to Winchester Circle to access it. Once inside
        you\'ll notice a ton of seating options around a long and winding bar. Behind there,
        amongst dozens of barrels, you\'ll find additional seating along with pool tables and
        pinball machines. The vast array of beers on the menu any given day can really dazzle
        you: everything from German and Belgian beers to stouts and a handful of IPAs.</string>
    <string name="brewery_jwells_description">J Wells\' motto tells you all you need to know:
        \"Life is too short for ordinary beer.\" At this intimate, dog&#8211;friendly nanobrewery
        you will find quite an array of beers &#8211;&#8211; especially for a small operation.
        The ambiance here is simple and minimalist&#8230; which helps you focus on beer, friends
        and a nice view of the Flatirons.</string>
    <string name="brewery_kettle_spoke_description">Here\'s a brewery that values bicycle culture
        &#8230; so much so that it shares its space with Green Guru, a bicycle accessories shop.
        The tasting room here is small and intimate, which is appropriate because they brew very
        small batches&#8211;&#8211;one barrel at a time. You may find an IPA on tap, along with a
        stout, a saison, or even a lager. The atmosphere is quintessentially Boulder&#8211;&#8211;
        very relaxed&#8211;&#8211;and sometimes includes live music out on to the south&#8211;facing
        patio.</string>
    <string name="brewery_mountain_sun_description">This is the original site of the small chain of
        \"Sun\" Pubs &amp; Breweries. Mountain Sun features a social, TV-free environment with about
        20 taps of their own ales and lagers, plus a versatile food menu that includes vegan and
        gluten&#8211;free options. The layout here is basically restaurant&#8211;style, with a
        small bar area and small patio on lively Pearl Street. They rotate about 75 beers per year
        so you can look for new releases constantly.</string>
    <string name="brewery_sanitas_description">Sanitas is a great place to hang out indoors,
        outdoors &#8211;&#8211; or both! Tucked away near some old abandoned railroad tracks, this
        brewery gives you some things to do while you sip, including games of bocce and cornhole.
        The brewers here put a lot of thought and purpose into the process, sometimes incorporating
        organic ingredients. They opened in 2013 with a few flagship beers and the plans to grow
        both sour and barrel programs.</string>
    <string name="brewery_twisted_pine_description">Since opening in 1995, Twisted Pine has grown
        steadily while keeping its local hang&#8211;out vibe. They brew a wide variety of beers here
        &#8211;&#8211; and keep you on your toes with rotating seasonals and the creative use of
        local ingredients (i.e. the "Roots Revival" is a Carrot IPA!). Look for a wide&#8211;ranging
        food menu and occasional live music. You'll also encounter \"zymeristas,\" Twisted Pine's
        term for its bartenders; it means they have extensive knowledge and training in all things
        beer!</string>
    <string name="brewery_upslope_description">Upslope Brewing Company was founded in 2008 in North
        Boulder with a seven barrel brewhouse. Business soared, so Upslope added a new, larger
        brewery (with a 30 bbl brewhouse) located in Flatiron Park, which opened in April of 2013.
        This larger brewery allows them to focus on brewing and canning their five core styles.
        Their Flatiron Park tap room has a laid-back atmosphere that\'s dog&#8211;friendly, allows
        customers to bring in their own food; they occasionally host food trucks, and have live
        music weekly. This Flatiron Park location is roomier than their original tap room and
        includes a \"Work Cafe,\" which can be rented out for private parties.</string>
    <string name="brewery_visionquest_description">Here\'s an innovative, artisan brewery off the
        beaten path. It\'s located in a cluster of industrial-style buildings and warehouses just
        a bit east of Foothills Parkway. The beer lineup here changes frequently with incredibly
        unique touches such as: a porter brewed with coffee, cinnamon and fire&#8211;roasted chili
        peppers; a stout brewed with white chocolate and vanilla; and an American IPA brewed with
        coconut flakes. Next door you\'ll notice a fermentation supply company which was here
        first&#8211;&#8211;the owners of that place opened VisionQuest once they started brewing
        beer on the side.</string>
    <string name="brewery_west_flanders_description">This is a chic place with an open-air feel on
        a warm day and a cozy feel on a cold day. Named after the famous beer province in Belgium,
        West Flanders backs up the moniker with a nice array of Belgian style beers. But they round
        out their lineup with a few American&#8211;influenced beers, guest taps and a bottle list.
        Check out the food menu, too. It has been carefully crafted so the dishes can pair well
        with the beers.</string>
    <string name="brewery_wild_woods_description">In the industrial warehouse district of east
        Boulder&#8230; there are Wild Woods! This little nanobrewery is tucked away and worth
        finding. The husband&#8211;wife ownership has created a homey feel to make you think
        \"cabin\" instead of "warehouse." Each beer is inspired by the outdoors, a concept which
        leads to a pale ale brewed with whole jasmine flowers.</string>

        Mountains.</string>
    <string name="hikes_eldorado_falls_description">The trail to Eldorado Falls is a 1.25-mile hike

        challenging adventure.</string>
